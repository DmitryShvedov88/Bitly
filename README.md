#Bitly URL shortener
###[TODO: put the project description here]
This application is designed to create short links through the bitly service. You just need to enter your link and the program will return a short one.

It is also possible to check how many times a short link was accessed. To do this, give a short link to the program input and get a response.

Run the program in the terminal and enter either a link or a short link and get the desired result.

How to install
###[TODO: tell the user where they should get access tokens, what these tokens look like and where they should be stored]

Python3 should already be installed. Use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

###pip install -r requirements.txt
